## Overview  
Welcome to my **COVID-19 Dashboard Project**!  
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing global COVID-19 data using **Tableau**. The goal is to create an interactive dashboard that tracks confirmed cases, death cases, and case trends across countries and over time.  

The dashboard provides key insights into the spread of the pandemic, helping to identify high-impact regions and global patterns.

## Project Description  
COVID-19 had a significant impact worldwide, and tracking its spread was essential for governments, organizations, and healthcare providers. In this project, I used Tableau to create a **dynamic and interactive dashboard** that visualizes critical COVID-19 metrics.  

The dashboard highlights:  
- Total confirmed cases and death cases (globally & by date).  
- Case trends over time.  
- Top 10 countries by COVID-19 cases.  
- Geographic distribution of cases (world map).

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project contains:    
- **Case Type**
- **People_Total_Tested_Count**
- **Cases**
- **Difference**
- **Date**  
- **Country/Region**
- **Province_State**
- **Population_Count**
- **People_Hospitalized_Cumulative_Count**
- **Data_Source**

- **Insight:** Helps identify countries and regions most affected by the pandemic.  

### 3. **Case Trends (Line Chart)**  
- **Description:** Trend of COVID-19 cases over time.  
- **Insight:** Clearly shows the exponential rise of cases, identifying peak outbreak periods.  

### 4. **Top 10 Countries (Bar Chart)**  
- **Description:** Highlights the top 10 countries with the highest number of cases.

To explore the dashboard:  
1. Download the Tableau file from this repository (`Covid19 dashboard.twb`).  
2. Open it in Tableau Desktop / Tableau Public.  
3. Interact with the filters (Date, Case Type) to analyze COVID-19 trends.

## Conclusion  
This COVID-19 Dashboard demonstrates my ability to:  
- Work with real-world datasets.  
- Design and build interactive dashboards in Tableau.  
- Provide meaningful insights from global data.  

It serves as a powerful visualization tool to understand the spread and impact of COVID-19 across the world.
